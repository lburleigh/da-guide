# CoIR Output

The resulting file from the 02_fit_models.py script is a single `.csv`, named with the variables defined in the script for the study. 

The result CSV will contain an accuracy and loss value obtained by the training and testing. The 4 values will be obtained for each algorithm run. Each run of each subject for each alpha-lambda hyper parameter combination of each CoIR, ridge with all subjects, and ridge with a single subject, will be output.

This output CSV can be analyzed in the statistical software of your choice, as any other data file.
