# When to use Domain Adaptation

Before determining the types of TL approaches that can and should be used for domain adaptation specifically, which situations transferring skills should be used and should not be used needs to be assessed. DA should not be used if the source and target domains are not related. For a source and target domain to be related, an explicit or implicit relationship must exist between the feature spaces of the two domains (e.g., same study methodology at different locations, same study methods only altering stimuli, similar questions addressed in studies, etc.). A brute-force transfer with domains that are not related to each other may be unsuccessful, and at worse, may hurt the learning performance in the target domain resulting in negative transfer. Negative transfer occurs when the source domain data and learning task lend to a reduced performance of learning in the target domain. Though little research has been done on this, negative transfer is an important limitation of TL, and therefore DA, to consider. For further investigation into negative transfer in DA, particularly detecting the point where negative transfer occurs in DA based on noise, see Gui et al. (2018): (Gui et al. 2017).
