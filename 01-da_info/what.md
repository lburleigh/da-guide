# What to Domain Adaptation

Traditional domain adaptation considers each dataset to be a different domain. This is beneficial and widely used in computer vision and natural language processing, however brain activity presents a particular challenge as participants can elicit different patterns of activity for the same cognitive process. In order to account for this, the current guide uses the Covariate Independence Regularization (CoIR) framework in which each subject is considered a unique learning task and extracts subject-specific features. Treating each dataset as a different domain as well as each subject as a different domain allows for a more robust model with each unique experiment-subject combination as a unique domain.
